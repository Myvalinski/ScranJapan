                <h6>History of the Japanese Tea Ceremony</h6>
                <br>

                <p><i>Although the bustling metropolis of Tokyo progresses toward a more modern pace, there are many traditions in Japanese culture that keep the population grounded, and its identity well-established. As one of the most long-lasting traditions, the tea ceremony, called chadō (茶道), is still practiced to this day, and has endured for hundreds of years since the introduction of green tea from China in the 9th century.
                </i></p>


                <p>Since around the year 815, when Buddhist monk Eichu made tea for Emperor Saga after bringing back seeds from Tang Dynasty China, a never-ending love affair with green tea was born in Japan. In its early stages, Japanese green tea was a luxury reserved for the upper class, including political and social elites.
                <br><br>
                As it later spread and became much more widely available, tea was consumed to sustain good health, and the serving of tea at the start of the New Year became ritual to repel illness, particularly during the Heian Period when disease ran rampant.
                <br><br>
                Later on during the Kamakura Period, around the year 1235, the formal Japanese tea ceremony began to take shape. This started with the Eihei Rules of Purity written by Zen monk Dogen, wherein the foundation of the modern tea ceremony is believed to be contained. It was also during this time that ceremonies for the general public were opened in places like Nara's Saidaiji Temple.
                <br><br>
                Perhaps the biggest push forward in framing the tea ceremony as we know it today comes from Zen monk Murata Juko, who brought the Wabicha method, infusing the Zen principle of chazenichimi, which placed heavy emphasis on simplicity. This solidified the spiritual aspect of tea ceremony, as previously imparted by monks like Eichun and Dogen who had come before.
                <br><br>
                A little over a century later in the Muromachi Period, Takeno Joo, along with his student Sen no Rikyu, carried on with Murata Juko's style of tea ceremony. In being the most influential masters of the ceremony, Joo and Rikyu had a tremendous impact on nearly every aspect of Japanese culture, from the arts, to philosophy and much more.
                <br><br>
                In the present day, there are many different styles of Japanese tea ceremony, but all are still deeply rooted in the Zen-inspired foundational principles of respect, inner and outer harmony, and simplicity established centuries ago.
                <br><br>
                </p>


                <h6>The Tea Ceremony Process</h6><br>

                <p> 
                    The tea ceremony follows a certain process made to illuminate the mind with precise movements and graceful hospitality. 
                    <br><br>

                    <h8>STEP 1</h8>
                    <br>
                    After guests have purified themselves, they will be greeted into the tea room and seated. Some tea houses offer sweets, which will be presented at this point in the process.
                    <br><br>

                    <h8>STEP 2</h8>
                    <br>
                    Next, the host will present the tools that will be used in the making of the tea, and clean these instruments with great detail.
                    <br><br>

                    <h8>STEP 3</h8>
                    <br>
                    Now, the actual tea preparation will begin. The host will start by making a thick, almost paste-like matcha mix, first by adding the powder and then adding water. The contents will be whisked together, then more water added gently to thin out the mixture.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <h8>STEP 4</h8>
                    <br>
                    The mix is offered to the main guest, who will examine the bowl and sample the tea. Afterward, the first guest will clean the bowl with the cloth and pass it to the second guest. The same process will follow until all guests have sampled the tea, after which point the bowl will be returned to the host.
                    <br><br>  

                    <h8>STEP 5</h8>
                    <br>
                    The host will clean the bowl a final time, along with all other instruments used for making the tea.
                    <br><br>  

                    <h8>STEP 6</h8>
                    <br>
                    Guests will carefully inspect the cleaned utensils as a sign of respect for the host's meticulousness.
                    <br><br>  

                    <h8>STEP 7</h8>
                    <br>
                    The ceremony will conclude with a final bow from both the host and the guests.
                    <br><br>  
                </p>


                <h6>Which Tea?</h6><br>

                <p> 
                    From sencha and other straight green teas to roasted hojicha tea, genmaicha tea with roasted brown rice to matcha green tea powder for the Japanese tea ceremony, Japanese tea is a rich and varied world that is holding increasing amounts of fascination for tea enthusiasts here in the UK.
                    <br><br>
                    The vast majority of tea drunk in Japan is some form of green tea. All green tea, from the standard brews to the best green teas in Japan and other countries, is packed to the brim with health benefits. As well as the small amounts of caffeine some of us need in the morning to get started with the day, green tea also contains plenty of antioxidants for body function and protection, amino acids that aid caffeine in brain function without causing the jittery 'buzz' of coffee, compounds that aid in weight loss and weight management, and anti-aging agents that are particularly good for the skin.
                    <br><br><br><br>

                    <h8 style="color: #c1f87a;"> Sencha Green Tea +</h8>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The collective term for all types of straight Japanese green tea is ryokucha, which literally means 'green tea'. Sencha is by far the most commonly consumed type of ryokucha in Japanese households, accounting for about 80% of all the tea produced in the country. Green tea is grown according to a yearly cycle, dependent on differing weather and temperatures. Early April to late May is known as the shincha (new tea) season, when the tea leaves are just sprouting and are at their most delicious and nutritionally dense. These new leaves are picked and quickly steamed to prevent oxidisation (the process that turns green tea into black tea), before being rolled, shaped, and dried. Sencha is often sorted into different grades based on the quality of its leaves, with the best quality leaves having the freshest and sweetest flavour. All sencha has a vegetative, grassy taste, usually with a slight hint of bitterness that adds to its refreshing quality.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>To get the best flavour out of sencha, it should be brewed for one minute in water with a starting temperature of 80°C. To bring freshly boiled water (which is normally around 90°C if boiled using a kettle) down to 80°C, the water is best poured into an open-topped vessel such as a jug, and left to stand for 1-2 minutes before it is poured into a teapot containing loose tea leaves or a teacup containing a sencha teabag. If a teapot is being used to make sencha, it is important that a strainer or infuser is used and the tea leaves lifted out after one minute. When sencha is brewed for too long it becomes very bitter.</i>
                    <br><br><br>

                    <h8 style="color: #c1f87a;"> Matcha Green Tea +</h8>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Matcha tea (or macha tea) is made out of shade-grown tea leaves, which are also used to make gyokuro (the highest quality variety of ryokucha). When these shade-grown tea leaves are harvested (by hand-picking, no less), they are steamed and then either rolled out and dried for making gyokuro, or they are laid out flat to dry before being de-veined, de-stemmed, and stone-ground to create bright green matcha tea powder. This powder is whisked directly into hot water to make Japanese matcha tea. Because the green tea leaves themselves are imbibed, matcha tea health benefits are more potent than those of any other type of green tea.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Matcha is the tea used traditionally in the Japanese tea ceremony. To make it, approximately 2g of matcha powder is added to a special bowl, along with hot water with a temperature between 70°C and 85°C. It is then whisked with a special bamboo whisk (known as a chasen in Japanese), until there are no lumps in the liquid and no matcha powder is stuck to the sides of the bowl.</i>
                    <br><br><br>

                    <h8 style="color: #c1f87a;"> Hojicha Roasted Green Tea +</h8>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Matcha tea (or macha tea) is made out of shade-grown tea leaves, which are also used to make gyokuro (the highest quality variety of ryokucha). When these shade-grown tea leaves are harvested (by hand-picking, no less), they are steamed and then either rolled out and dried for making gyokuro, or they are laid out flat to dry before being de-veined, de-stemmed, and stone-ground to create bright green matcha tea powder. This powder is whisked directly into hot water to make Japanese matcha tea. Because the green tea leaves themselves are imbibed, matcha tea health benefits are more potent than those of any other type of green tea.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Hojicha is a more hardy tea than sencha and other types of green tea, and its flavour diffuses more quickly. It should be brewed in freshly boiled water, and the loose tea leaves or teabag should be left in for just 30 seconds.</i>
                    <br><br><br>

                    <h8 style="color: #c1f87a;"> Kobucha Kombu Kelp Tea +</h8>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Also known as kombucha, kobucha is not made from tea leaves, even though it has the word 'tea' in its name. It is instead an infusion of dried and powdered kombu kelp seaweed. Kombu contains high volumes of glutamic acid, which gives any food to which it is added a savoury umami flavour. Kobucha has a similar umami flavour, and will sometimes be made with infusions of ume plums to add an additional salty/sour quality.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Nowadays kobucha is normally sold as a dissolvable powder, with any extra flavourings (such as ume plum seasoning) already mixed in. Making it is therefore as easy as adding a spoonful to boiling water and stirring.</i>
                    <br><br><br>
